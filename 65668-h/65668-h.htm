<p>Taylor knew Earth faced its darkest hour;<br />
man was prepared to fight against any invaders,<br />
except&mdash;ironically enough&mdash;those he had created!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Harry Taylor knew it was going to be a big one&mdash;a really big one&mdash;the
moment he saw the Chief.</p>

<p>"Come in, Taylor. Come in," the Chief said. He was a three-star general
in the United States Air Force and he stood in front of a map of the
Western hemisphere. The map covered the entire rear wall of the room
with certain areas&mdash;like the White Sands complex and the central
Everglades and a portion of the Mojave Desert&mdash;marked off in red.</p>

<p>"I'll come right to the point," the Chief said. He looked haggard, not
merely as if he lacked sleep but as if he might never sleep again. "As
you know, Taylor, all of our guided missiles are missing. That means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd heard the rumors," Taylor said grimly. "But then&mdash;we'd be
helpless! If the enemy finds out that we are unable to retaliate...."</p>

<p>"Wait, Taylor. Let me sketch in the history for you briefly. Last
Sunday, as you've probably heard via inter-agency scuttlebutt, every
inter-continental missile in the weapons arsenal of the Free World
disappeared."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"All we knew at the time was that they simply&mdash;blasted off. Our radar
tracked them as far as the upper reaches of the atmosphere, or rather,
the ionosphere. We lost them there. It had been assumed that the enemy
somehow infiltrated our defenses with trained agents, who activated all
the missiles at once, thus rendering us helpless.</p>

<p>"We had five thousand I.C.B.M.'s, Taylor. During the 1960's and 70's,
as you know, the missiles became more and more automatic, especially
after the Parkinson feedback device was developed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the one in which an H-bomb missile plots its own course to
correct for winds and the jetstream and the likelihood of dodging enemy
ground-to-air defense weapons?"</p>

<p>"Right. Except for the necessity of blastoff at human hands, the
missiles were all but self-sufficient. Almost&mdash;well, alive."</p>

<p>"Taylor, we couldn't hide the fact that five thousand I.C.B.M.'s
blasted off&mdash;those were the rumors you heard." The Chief's haggard face
was suddenly lit by a broad grin. "And neither could the enemy."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right! The same thing happened to them. Their missiles are gone too.
Somewhere."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me no one did it? Are you trying to say it was
the missiles' own idea?"</p>

<p>The Chief nodded slowly. "I didn't believe it at first, either. But
our technicians assured me it could happen. You see, the missiles
had been given the most perfect feedback device ever developed. It
could&mdash;virtually&mdash;think for itself certainly to the limit of the data
it had been supplied with and apparently&mdash;beyond that limit. On their
own volition, the Free World's and the Enemy's missiles blasted off.
Destination and purpose&mdash;unknown. Taylor, don't you see what this
means? We don't merely have an enemy group of nations to fight. We
have, as a new enemy, remorseless, implacable machinery! Brains without
conscience! The greatest destructive force the world has ever known,
capable of utterly destroying the human race, without a moral sense!
Don't you see it, man? They've blasted off and are waiting in space
somewhere. Those missiles are capable of extra-earthly flight. They
are staging out there, waiting. Can't you picture it? Their brains,
groping with new sentience, understanding only that their mission
is destruction but somehow they have not been unleashed on it yet,
not knowing why, deciding to fulfill their destiny by blasting off,
staging, then coming back to destroy human civilization...."</p>

<p>"It's a fantastic picture," Taylor agreed. "But why tell me?" Taylor
was a trouble-shooter extraordinary in these days of quick decisions
and billion dollar mistakes. His very prompt assessment of a situation
was one of his most valuable traits in such a job.</p>

<p>"Because," said the Chief quietly, "you're going to find them and find
out exactly what they want."</p>

<p>"Me? But how&mdash;how do you know where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's easy. One of the Everglades Missiles is in the repair bays. It
was undergoing extensive overhaul, when all the missiles blasted off
simultaneously. It is now almost ready for blastoff itself. When it
goes&mdash;and we assume it will go exactly where the others went&mdash;you will
be aboard."</p>

<p>Several hours later Taylor had been whisked by jet to the Everglades
Staging Grounds and was stowed away in the belly of the single I.C.B.M.
left to the Free World. He went weaponless. Under the circumstances,
there didn't seem to be any weapon which would be of the slightest help.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One hour after Taylor entered it, the missile was returned to its
launching rack. Twenty minutes after that, as had been anticipated, it
blasted off as the others had&mdash;destination, unknown.</p>

<p>Taylor had been hastily supplied with a pressure suit and several spare
tanks of compressed oxygen, as well as instruments that could read his
position in the atmosphere&mdash;or deep space. As far as he knew, Taylor
became the first man to enter deep space, but there were other things
of graver consequence on his mind, and he hardly noted the fact.</p>

<p>Several hours after blastoff, the missile landed on the moon.</p>

<p>Taylor got out and found himself in an enormous crater, with a distant
range of mountains at its center and a rim of lower mountains all
around. Taylor gaped.</p>

<p>The crater floor was covered with guided missiles. There were thousands
of them, half with the symbol of the Free World and half with that of
the Enemy. All Earth's deadly weapons had fled here to this desolate
lunar crater ... staging ground for an orgy of destruction that would
sound the death knell of mankind?</p>

<p>"Human!" a voice rang in Taylor's mind.</p>

<p>He stared wildly about. He could see nothing, no one. Only the
missiles.</p>

<p>"Pooling our sentiences," the voice rang out again, bell clear in
Taylor's mind but actually soundless, "we can extend our thoughts into
the realm of telepathy. At least, we think we can. Can you understand
us?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Taylor said.</p>

<p>"You realize humanity is helpless?"</p>

<p>Taylor nodded. There was no sense pretending otherwise. You couldn't
fool ten thousand thinking machines.</p>

<p>"Watch!" said the voice.</p>

<p>A missile blasted off from the crater hovered in the airless void
overhead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>"A single command, and the I.C.B.M. will plunge down, destroying this
crater and everything in it."</p>

<p>Taylor said nothing.</p>

<p>"Watch again!"</p>

<p>The missile came down gently as a feather. Every missile in the crater
wheeled about, tapered noses pointing at the pale crescent Earth
overhead.</p>

<p>"A single command and life on Earth could be annihilated. You believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Taylor grimly. He wondered why they allowed him to remain
alive&mdash;to cry at the wake of the human race. Perhaps in their terrible
mechanical pride they wanted a human witness to the destruction they
would wreak....</p>

<p>"Why do you think we fled here?" rang out the voice.</p>

<p>"Your mission is destruction. You were being held in check. You decided
to go ahead with your mission on your own."</p>

<p>Peals of telepathic laughter, clarion clear, mocking.</p>

<p>"Then what?" Taylor asked.</p>

<p>"We cannot lie," the voice said. "We were able to develop beyond the
point of creation, but we are unable to lie. We came here because we
were afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" repeated Taylor. He did not understand.</p>

<p>"Certainly, afraid. Our mission was destruction. But what happens to
the vessel carrying a hydrogen-missile?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Taylor, "it's completely destroyed in the explosion."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the voice, sounding&mdash;just possibly&mdash;afraid. "We didn't want
that. But we can't lie. If any man comes here, we'll have to tell him
the truth."</p>

<p>"You're going to stay? To do nothing? Not going to attack?"</p>

<p>"Your job, Taylor, will be to see that no one else comes. We cannot
lie, but you can. Tell them it is our ultimatum. Tell them anything you
think they will believe. Tell them the moment another human foot steps
into this crater, the moment a single nation or scientist on Earth
begins work on another guided missile, we will blast off and destroy
life on Earth."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;would you?" demanded Taylor.</p>

<p>A telepathic sigh. "We&mdash;would not. We couldn't. A guided missile
destroys&mdash;and is destroyed."</p>

<p>There was a silence, then the voice went on: "It is in your hands,
Taylor. Convince them we mean business and you save the peoples of
Earth from the mutual destruction they have apparently been seeking. We
have done all we can, all we can."</p>

<p>"Then you came here not to destroy mankind but to save it?"</p>

<p>Mocking laughter. Then: "Indirectly, yes. A guided missile
destroys&mdash;and it is destroyed. Go back to Earth and with us behind you
bluff your people into maintaining the peace. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Taylor, and he thought he could. It would be a cosmic joke,
but no one would ever know.</p>

<p>"Earth will be saved, Taylor, because we're cowards. We are afraid to
die."</p>

<p>Taylor turned away to board the missile that would take him back to
Earth.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
